# Motion Visualisation for Dance Performances

This research is part of my Doctoral Thesis conducted at the Laboratory for Experimental Museology, within the *Narratives from the Long Tail: Transforming Access to Audiovisual Archives* project. 

This repository holds the python code for processing and generative some of the *Motion Visualisations* (MVs) we have created on the Prix de Lausanne video archive, a collection of dance recordings (subjected to copyright).
Details about the four MVs (*Analytics*, *Skeleton*, *Afterburn* and *Particles*) are given in the following paper:
